# Engineering React Rebase Challenge

You will be expected to be able to contribute features and fixes without causing conflicts and other version control headaches. An important tool for keeping codebases clean is `git rebase`. This challenge will test your understanding of a basic codebase and your ability to use `git rebase` properly.

## The Challenge

There are two pull requests open on this repo. Each change is in its own branch. The challenge is to use `git rebase` to add both changes to `main`. When you are finished, your `main` branch should have three commits in the following order:

```
* feat: add Biology Today article
* feat: add Auto Review article
* fiat lux
```

_Any errors, missing features, missing tests, or failing tests will disqualify the solution._

## Instructions

How to attempt this challenge:

1) Clone this repo locally
2) Solve the challenge locally
3) Create a new repo in your GitHub account and note the git url
4) Set your local origin to the new git url: `git remote set-url origin ${git url}`
5) Push your solution to the newly set origin

You must follow these steps for your solution to be accepted -- **forks or other methods will not be considered.**
